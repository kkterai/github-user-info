## Tech/framework used

<b>Bootstrapped with [Create React App]("https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app"), meaning that this little app was built with this Tech at minimum:
- [React]("https://reactjs.org") 
- [Webpack]("https://webpack.js.org")
- [Babel]("https://babeljs.io")

## Updating to New Releases

Create React App is divided into two packages:

- `create-react-app` is a global command-line utility used to create this project.
- `react-scripts` is a development dependency in this project.

You almost never need to update `create-react-app` itself: it delegates all the setup to `react-scripts`.

To update to a new version of `react-scripts`, [open the changelog](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), find the version you’re currently on (check `package.json` in this folder if you’re not sure), and apply the migration instructions for the newer versions.

In most cases bumping the `react-scripts` version in `package.json` and running `npm install` (or `yarn install`) in this folder should be enough, but it’s good to consult the [changelog](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for potential breaking changes.
